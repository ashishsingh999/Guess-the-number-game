# Guess-the-number-game
The users have to guess a number between 1 & 20, which is a random number generated by the program. If the number that the user has guessed is higher or lower than the number generated by the program, the user will get a message that the number which the user has guessed is Too High!! and Too Low!! respectively to assist the user in making more informed guesses the next time. The game has a Highscore field which will display the current highscore of the user. Suppose, the user has guessed the correct number in the 5th attemp so the user's highscore would be (20 - 5) i, e. 15.
